# Snake-Ai
Snake A.I is a game I made where you are the snake and your goal is to eat as many apples as possible. However, there is an additional snake that uses dijkstra's algorithm (pathfinding) to calculate the quickest root of the apple, making it incredibly difficult for your snake to collect apples.
